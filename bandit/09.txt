In the home directory of the user bandit8, type:

~$ ls
data.txt

Again, we have a file composed of many things. In the
challenge website, we are informed that the password is
the only line of the text that occurs only once. Thus,
we can use the <sort> and <uniq> commands to find that
line:

~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

Use the above password to ssh to bandit9.
