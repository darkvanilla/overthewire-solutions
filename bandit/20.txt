In the home directory of the user bandit19, type ls:

~$ ls
bandit20-do

We now see an executable. The challenge website tells us that we
can use this executable to run commands as if we are the user
bandit20. Let's see what it outputs if we run it without any args:

~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id

Since the password file is under /etc/bandit_pass directory, let's
try opening it with this executable:

~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

Voila! Use this password to ssh to the user bandit20.
