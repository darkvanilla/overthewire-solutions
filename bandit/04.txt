In the home directory of the user bandit3, type ls:

~$ ls
inhere

Enter the directory inhere:

~$ cd inhere && ls

We see no output from ls. Let's try using the find
command to see whether there is a hidden file:

~/inhere$ find . -name *
.
./.hidden

As seen, there is a hidden file with special chars.
Cat the file to get the password. As similar to previous
challenges, use quotes to avoid special char problems:

~/inhere$ cat "./.hidden"
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

Using the password above, ssh to the user bandit4.
