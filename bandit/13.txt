In the home directory of the user bandit12, type ls:

~$ ls
data.txt

Again, we need to find the password from the given file.
Looking at the challenge website, we see that data.txt
is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.
Given this information, let's proceed by first creating a
tmp directory and working there step-by-step:

~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g

~$ cd /tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ cp ~/data.txt ./

Now, since we can reverse the hexdump to obtain the file
using <xxd> command:

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ xxd -r data.txt > data.bin

Now, let's inspect the type of the file using <file> command:

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data.bin
data.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Mon Nov 13 14:58:07 2017, max compression, from Unix

We see that it was compressed using gzip. Let's uncompress it:

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ mv data.bin data.gz && gunzip data.gz

Now, we have a file named "data". We will do the similar steps
above, until we get an uncompressed file:

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data
data: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ bunzip2 data
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data.out
data.out: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Mon Nov 13 14:58:07 2017, max compression, from Unix

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ mv data.out data.gz && gunzip data.gz
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data
data: POSIX tar archive (GNU)

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ tar -x -f data 
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data5.bin
data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ tar -x -f data5.bin
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data6.bin
data6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ bunzip2 data6.bin
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data6.bin.out
data6.bin.out: POSIX tar archive (GNU)

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ tar -x -f data6.bin.out
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data8.bin
data8.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Mon Nov 13 14:58:07 2017, max compression, from Unix

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ mv data8.bin data8.gz && gunzip data8.gz
/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ file data8
data8: ASCII text

Finally, we reached an uncompressed ASCII text file. Let's
read it:

/tmp/tmp.aGvJH7mK2g$ cat data8
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

Using the above password, ssh to the user bandit13.
