In the home directory of the user bandit2, type ls:

~$ ls
spaces in this filename

Since there are space characters in the filename, we
cannot directly write its name in the terminal. Instead,
we should use single or double quotes:

~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

Using the password above, ssh to the user bandit3.
