In the home directory of the user bandit11, type ls:

~$ ls
data.txt

We again have some data from which we should obtain the
password. In the challenge website, we see that it is
encoded using ROT13. So, let's see the encoded version:

~$ cat data.txt
Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh

Now, we can use <tr> to translate all characters to
their original positions (by shifting 13 positions):

~$ data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu

Using the above password, ssh to the user bandit12.

Note that <tr>'s first argument is the set of chars
that are to be translated, and they are the uppercase
chars A-Z, and the lowercase chars a-z. In the second
argument, we tell <tr> to convert [A-Z] to [N-Z] union [A-M],
and convert [a-z] to [n-z] union [a-m]. [E.g.: A -> N,
Z -> M, b -> o, etc.]
