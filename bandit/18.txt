In the home directory of the user bandit17, type ls:

~$ ls
passwords.new   passwords.old

As seen, we have 2 passwords files. In the challenge website,
we are informed that the password is in the file passwords.new,
and it is the only line that does not appear in passwords.old.
Thus, we can use <diff> to get the password for this level:

~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old
42c42
< kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
---
> 6vcSC74ROI95NqkKaeEC2ABVMDX9TyUr

So, our password for the user bandit18 is:

kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd

Use this password to ssh to user bandit18.
