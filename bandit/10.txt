In the home directory of the user bandit9, type ls:

~$ ls
data.txt

Again, we have a large data among which we should find
the password. Looking at the challenge website, we are
informed that the password is one of the few human-
readable strings in data.txt, and it begins with several
'=' characters. So, we can use <strings> to get the
human-readable strings from the file, and use <sort> and
<uniq> commands to reduce the number of outputs. Moreover,
we can use <grep> command to find the lines containing
a '=' character:

~$ strings data.txt | sort | uniq | grep '='
)========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
4H5=

========== password
========== theOkM

>]".x=
H)=QU
L=8@
e=y:
{=jh
{=u/,i_
~BX=

As seen above, the first line of the output looks like
promising. Using that password, i.e.;

truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk

we are able to ssh to the user bandit10.
