In the home directory of the user bandit13, type ls:

~$ ls
sshkey.private

We now have a private SSH key, different than the previous
challenges. Looking at the challenge website, we see that the
password for this level is stored at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14,
and can only be read by user bandit14. So, we need to
use the SSH key to connect to the user bandit14:

~$ ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private

Now, we are connected to the user bandit14! Let's read the
password:

~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

Using the above password, ssh from your local machine to the
user bandit14.
