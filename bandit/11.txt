In the home directory of the user bandit10, type ls:

~$ ls
data.txt

Again, we have some data in which we need to find the
password. In the website, we see that it contains
base64-encoded data. So, we can decode it as follows:

~$ base64 -d data.txt
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

Using that password, ssh to the user bandit11.
