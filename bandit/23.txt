Let us look at the contents of the directed folder:

~$ ls /etc/cron.d
cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24  popularity-contest

We need to read bandit23's cronjob file:

~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null

Okay, so we again have a shell script. Let us read it:

~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh 
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

As seen, the script gets the username as <myname>, which is <bandit23>.
Then, it gets a md5sum (the MD5 hash), and cuts the result so as to
remove the clutter. Then, copies the password into the /tmp/ folder
with the name given as this MD5 hash. So, let us find the MD5 hash of
the sentence "I am user bandit23":

~$ echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

Then, look at the /tmp/ folder to see whether we have a filename with
this MD5 hash:

~$ ls /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
/tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

Great! We have the file. Let us read its contents:

~$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n

So the password of bandit23 is: jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
