Upon listing the home directory, we see an sshkey file:

~$ ls
bandit26.sshkey

However, when we connect using the file

~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost

we immediately get disconnected. Let us see the type of shell
bandit26 uses:

~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext

Interesting. Let us look what /showtext program does:

~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0

As seen, it runs the command <more> and exits immediately. So, it seems
like there is not much things that we can do at this point. However, we
can maybe make use of <more> command, which does not exit immediately if the
text it shows does not fit to the screen. Let us try to resize our screen,
so that the logo shown does not fit.

Now, it seems that we are still in the <more> program. This is good. At
this point, we should somehow be able to run commands from <more>. Doing
some research, we learn that we can enter to Vim by pressing [v] in <more>.
Doing so, we are now in Vim.

At this point, we can tell Vim to show the password of bandit26:

:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

Voila! We obtain the password of bandit26: 5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z
