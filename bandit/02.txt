In the home directory of the user bandit1, first create
a tmp directory to work on:

~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.ppRl7SMDJW

Change your working directory to the above directory:

~$ cd /tmp/tmp.ppRl7SMDJW

Now, since the name of the file is the dash character,
i.e., '-', which is a special character, we cannot open
the file in a straightforward manner. However, we
can change the name of the file to be able to open it,
while copying it to our current directory:

/tmp/tmp.ppRl7SMDJW$ cp ~/- ./readable.txt && cat readable.txt

Using the above password, ssh to the user bandit2, as 
similar to the previous challenges.
