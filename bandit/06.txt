In the home directory of the user bandit5, enter:

~$ ls
inhere

Change to that directory:

~$ cd inhere && ls
maybehere00  maybehere04  maybehere08  maybehere12  maybehere16
maybehere01  maybehere05  maybehere09  maybehere13  maybehere17
maybehere02  maybehere06  maybehere10  maybehere14  maybehere18
maybehere03  maybehere07  maybehere11  maybehere15  maybehere19

We have 20 directories, and probably much more files.
So, we cannot manually check all of them. In the website of
the challenge, we learn that the password is stored in a file,
which is:
    
    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

Using these properties, we can find the file with the find
command. Reading the manual of the find command:

~/inhere$ man find

We can search for terms "readable" and "size" to find which
options specify those. From the man page, we learn the option
-readable finds the human-readable files, and the option
-size finds files with special sizes. In particular, we should
use the following command:

~/inhere$ find . -type f -readable -size 1033c
./maybehere07/.file2

We found the file! If the search returned more files, we could
also use the "not executable" feature to improve the search.

Get the contents of the file:

~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

Use the above password to ssh to the user bandit6.
