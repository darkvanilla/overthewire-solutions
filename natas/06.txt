In natas5, we see the following response:

Access disallowed. You are not logged in

So, let us inspect what is going on with Burp Suite. Looking at the
HTTP GET parameters, we see the following:

GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org
User-Agent: (...)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: loggedin=0
Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM1OmlYNklPZm1wTjdBWU9RR1B3dG4zZlhwYmFKVkpjSGZx
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
DNT: 1

As seen, we have a Cookie this time, and it says "loggedin=0". This
is probably why we are getting that message. Since 0 probably means
"False", let us change it to 1 so it becomes "True", by sending the
request to the Repeater.

Doing so, on the right pane of the Repeater, we see the following
response:

Access granted. The password for natas6 is aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

So, the credentials are:

Username: natas6
Password: aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1
