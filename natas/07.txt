In natas6, we are asked for a secret in a submit form. We also
have the option to view the page source by clicking the link on the
website, and we see the following in the HTML body:

<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

The above part is a PHP code fragment, where the webpage is told to
print "Access granted. ..." if an HTTP POST parameter "submit" exists,
and if the $secret variable is equal to the POST parameter "secret".
In other words, we should send the correct secret through the form.

Notice that in the PHP code part, the variable $secret should be defined
before checked against the thing we send. However, it seems like it
was not defined. On the other hand, the <include> statement could be
defining it. So, let us try browsing to the file that the PHP code
includes:

http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc

We just have a blank page. But let us view the page source.

view-source:http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc

<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>

as we predicted, the variable $secret is defined here. So, we should
enter this variable's value, i.e.; FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU to the input form.

Upon doing so, we get the following message:

Access granted. The password for natas7 is 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9 

So, the credentials are:

Username: natas7
Password: 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9
