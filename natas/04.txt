In natas3, viewing the source code, we see an interesting HTML
comment:

<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
</div>

Wow! "Not even Google will find it this time..." This looks like
a hint to us. If a search engine could not find a thing, it is most
probably because it is directed to do so by "robots.txt". Let us
check it:

http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt

User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/

Yes, the website disallows the folder /s3cr3t to be indexed by the
search engines. Let us try entering there:

http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/

We again see the contents of the folder, and the file "users.txt".
Let us open the file:

http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/users.txt

Voila! So, the credentials are:
