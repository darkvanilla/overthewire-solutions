In natas4, we read the following message:

Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users 
should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"

So, we should somehow trick the webpage that we are coming from
that website.

At this point, we could make use of the "Referer" header in the
HTTP GET request. To manipulate the HTTP traffic, I will be using
Burp Suite (Community Edition). You may also use this program, or
choose a similar tool.

To be able to intercept the web traffic with Burp, first open your
web browser, and change the proxy settings. Enter a manual proxy
with the IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and port 8080 (which are
the default settings for Burp; you may change these from the settings).

In Burp, let us send the HTTP GET request to the Repeater by right-
clicking and choosing "Send to repeater". Then, let us modify the
Referer as http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/. Click Go, and
on the right pane, you will see the response:

Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq

So, the credentials are:

Username: natas5
Password: iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq
