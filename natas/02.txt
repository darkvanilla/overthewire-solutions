In natas1, right-clicking is blocked on the website. So,
we should follow another method to view the page source. To do
so, one option is to block the JavaScript, which is the
thing that blocks right-clicking.

In Chrome, press the information symbol to the left of the URL
bar, click "Site Settings", and block JavaScript. Then, reload
the page, and click right. As you can see, we are now able to
click. View the page source, and again, we have an HTML comment:

<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->

So, credentials are:

Username: natas2
Password: ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi
