In natas2, viewing the source code of the webpage, this time
we don't see any HTML comments. However, there is an image
included, which is suspicious:

<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<img src="files/pixel.png">
</div>

Clicking the image, we see it is just a white 1x1 pixel. Thus,
probably this is a hint to us. Noticing the image source, i.e.,
files/pixel.png, we see there is a folder named "files". Let
us try browsing there:

http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/.

We are able to see the contents of the folder. And there is a
.txt file apart from the pixel.png, which is "users.txt". Let us
click on that:
